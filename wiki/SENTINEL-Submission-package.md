### 🎯 **30-Second Pitch** (Memorize This)

> "SENTINEL is AI agent infrastructure for Cronos. We built a working vault with 4 AI agents that monitor risk, optimize settlements, and prevent emergencies—all with on-chain transparency and safety guarantees. But we didn't stop there. We also created a reusable SDK so ANY Cronos developer can add AI agents to their contracts in minutes. We're not just building a product—we're enabling an entire ecosystem of AI-native applications."
