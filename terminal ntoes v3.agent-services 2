{"output":"The SimpleVault contract on Cronos is a smart contract designed to securely hold and manage deposits of a specific ERC-20 token. It allows users to deposit tokens 
into the vault and later withdraw them, often with restrictions such as timelocks or maximum withdrawal amounts. 
This ensures controlled asset custody, enabling applications to safeguard funds, enforce withdrawal limits, or implement vesting schedules within a decentralized environment."}

{"output":"The SimpleVault contract on Cronos is a secure smart contract designed to hold and manage tokens
 on behalf of users or other contracts. It allows authorized entities to deposit tokens into the vault and 
 withdraw them later, ensuring safe custody. Typically, it enforces access controls and may include features 
 like withdrawal limits or time locks to prevent unauthorized or excessive withdrawals. The primary function 
 is to act as a trust-minimized escrow or storage solution for tokens within DeFi applications."}
